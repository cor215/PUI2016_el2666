## Homework 1

I wanted to leave a comment here on my fork assignment. Instead of a neighbor, I did it with my older account in github - github name: levie481 and forked the existing repository that was there called "hello-world". Just wanted to leave it here for the information.

I created alias (pui2016) and environmental variable ($PUI2016) for the path to my folder (NYU netid = el2666):
/home/cusp/el2666

Here are the screenshots:

Thank you -
