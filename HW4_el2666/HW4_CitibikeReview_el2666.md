A). Null and Alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly:
The ratio of female riders to male riders is taken against the time of the day, which is narrowed down and specified as intervals for the morning time (7-10 am) and for the evening time (4-7 time). 

B). The data supports the project:
The data chosen has all required variables - the initial database with multiple variables has been pre-processed and narrowed down to only required variables. 

C). The test that could be performed is t-Test as it tests the difference between two groups (female and male riders) on one DV (time of the day).
